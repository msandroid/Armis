- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).

### Error Handling and Validation
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.

- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that can be caught and shown to the user.
- Use next-safe-action for all server actions.
- Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses.
